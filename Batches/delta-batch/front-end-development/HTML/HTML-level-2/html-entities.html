    <!-- 
        An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand(&) and ends with a semicolon(;).
        
        Used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML Code), and invisible characters(like non-breaking spaces).

        Can also use in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standerd keyboard.

        Browser interprets them & renders correct character.
